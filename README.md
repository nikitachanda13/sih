# 🌊 FloatChat
AI-Powered Conversational Interface for ARGO Ocean Data Discovery and Visualization
FloatChat is an interactive platform that combines ARGO float oceanographic data, machine learning models, and a conversational AI assistant into a single dashboard. It allows researchers, students, and ocean enthusiasts to explore, analyze, and visualize global ocean data in an intuitive way.

# ✨ Features
📊 Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)

Explore ARGO floats by region, depth, and time

Visualize T–S (Temperature–Salinity) diagrams, vertical profiles, and time series

View float trajectories on global maps


🤖 Machine Learning Insights

Clustering: Group water masses using T–S profiles

Forecasting: Predict temperature/salinity at different depths

Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual profiles (possible El Niño signatures, etc.)

💬 AI-Powered Conversational Query
Ask natural-language questions like:

“What was the average salinity at 1000m depth in the Pacific Ocean last year?”

Get results as text + charts

📥 Export Options

Download processed datasets (CSV/NetCDF)

Save plots as PNG for reports
